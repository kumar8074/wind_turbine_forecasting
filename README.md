# Wind Turbine Performance Optimization (WTPO) - Time Series Forecasting

## Project Overview
Wind energy plays a crucial role in the global shift toward sustainable power generation. This project presents a comprehensive analysis and prediction system for wind turbine performance using deep learning techniques, with a primary focus on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time series forecasting.

The system provides a complete pipeline for:
- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Feature engineering for time series data
- LSTM-based deep learning model training
- Performance evaluation and prediction
- Model persistence and deployment

## Dataset Description
This data is taken from Wind Turbines Scada system that is working and generating power is turkey for the year 2018.

    Features:
        - Date/Time (for 10 minutes intervals)
        - LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment
        - Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation)
        - Theoretical_Power_Curve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer
        - Wind Direction (°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly)

## Features
- **Modular Pipeline Architecture**: Separated into distinct components for data ingestion, transformation, model training, and prediction
- **LSTM-based Forecasting**: Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory networks for accurate time series prediction
- **Configurable Parameters**: Easy configuration of model hyperparameters and data processing steps
- **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models for deployment
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for monitoring and debugging
